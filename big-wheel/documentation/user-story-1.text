As the 'Big Wheel' operator, 
I need to keep track of contestants' spins,
so that the game state is correctly managed.

Acceptance Criteria - Game:

01 - One or more players are required.

02 - A player is 'out' if they score more than 100 points.

03 - The 1st player in the current round becomes the 'high score player' if 
     they are not 'out' at the end of their turn.

04 - The game ends if there is no high score tie at the end of 
     regulation or overtime.     

05 - The winner is the player with the hightest score under 
     or at 100 points, if there is no tie for highest score.     

06 - There is no winner if all players are 'out' (went over 100 points).

07 - The 'Big Wheel' has 10 numbers in this order: 100, 15, 70, 55, 80, 20, 65, 35, 40, 10


Acceptance Criteria - Turns

01 - Each player gets a maximum of 2 spins in round 1 (regulation).

02 - A player can stop at one spin.

03 - A player's turn ends if they reach 100 points in one or two spins.

04 - After player 1's turn, other players become the 'high score player' 
     if their score beats th previous player's score.

05 - Any spin that does not go 'all the way around' does not count 
     and must be re-spun.

06 - A spin goes 'all the way around' if it is moves the total number of 
     spaces plus one.


Acceptance Criteria - overtime

01 - If any players are tied at or under 100 points, after each player has 
     had their turn then the tied players go to 'overtime' if their score 
     is the high score.

02 - An 'overtime' round follows the same rules as regulation, with the excption that there 
     is only one spin per turn.     

03 - At the end of an overtime round, if there are tied players then they 
     play another overtime round, until there is no tie.
