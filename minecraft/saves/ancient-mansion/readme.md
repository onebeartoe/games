Description (from site):
Reddit user u/crackedmagnet brings us a pretty rare seed:

  Woodland Mansion (X:88 Z:120) with
  Ancient City (X:152 Z:72) underneath
  and a Village near them (20, 120, -20) tminehat works for both Bedrock and Java.

  Then you can also find a Stronghold (X:1316 Z:-720)
            Chunkbase - Village 1344, -160
  as well as another Mansion (X:728 Z:-568)
  and Village (X:-320 Z:-480).

  It is definitely a one-of-a-kind seed thatâ€™s worthy of being part
  of your collection.
