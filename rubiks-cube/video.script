00- Greeting

	Hi, I am Roberto Marquez.   In this video I demonstrate a user story 
            for converting a Java Applet to a Swing application that is run from the 
            command line (instead of a Web Browser).

01 - Tools used in this project include:

        computer

        web browser

        Java IDE

        BASH terminal

02 - User Story Review

    As a Java conservationist,
    I need a way to convert AWT Applets to Swing applications,
    so that I can revive older applications into (semi) modern ones.
	
03 - Demonstrate Acceptance Criteria in Software

    show the AWT & Swing workspaces

    show the Applet to JFrame wrapper

    mention the 'gotcha' methods and remediation 

04 - Demonstrate Acceptance Criteria in Real Life

    run the appilcation from the command line

05 - Outro
    
    I hope you enjoyed the demonstration of this user story and I encourage you 
    to explore the ideas presented in this â€¦ video.

    Thanks for watching; like and subscribe for more Java content.
